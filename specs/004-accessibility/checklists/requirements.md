# Specification Quality Checklist: Accessibility

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validated on 2026-10-22 in one pass: 5 user stories, 19 functional requirements traced to board
  tasks #161–#168 and FR-A11Y-01 to FR-A11Y-05, 6 success criteria.
- Three assumptions are marked "to confirm in Clarify" (#156): VoiceOver states when hints are
  off, how Light and Dark differ without color, and one announcement per step.
